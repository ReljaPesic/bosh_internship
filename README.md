# Internship Task – Backend Project

This repository contains my solution for the internship assignment.

## Notes on Implementation
I wasn’t able to implement every planned feature (including full JWT authentication and complete Dockerization of the application), but I’d like to emphasize that working on this task was both fun and highly educational.

For a detailed overview of how the project evolved, please check the commit history in this repository.

## What is Implemented
- ✅ **Task 1** – fully covered
- ✅ **Task 2** – partially covered (without JWT authentication)
- ✅ **Task 3** – database was Dockerized (optional part of the task)

## What is Missing
- ❌ Full JWT-based authentication
- ❌ Complete Dockerization of the entire project

## Reflections
Overall, I am very satisfied with the result, especially considering this was my **first time working with this framework** and that I completed everything in just **three days**.

This project gave me a great opportunity to explore new concepts and strengthen my backend development skills.
